description: "Cedar earned his PhD at Oregon State University, where he worked with Dr. John Fowler to develop a [high-throughput maize ear phenotyping system](https://doi.org/10.1111/tpj.15166) to track reproductive mutant fitness.


Cedar is interested in creating [new methods](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00497-021-00407-2) for understanding how genetic variation influences plant fitness in response to environmental stress.
