# Welcome to the Palanivelu Lab!
{: .display-3}
<br>
We are part of the [School of Plant Sciences](https://cals.arizona.edu/spls/home) at the [Univeristy of Arizona](https://www.arizona.edu/). We are interested in understanding how plant cells communicate with each other. To accomplish this goal, we are using pollen tube interactions with pistils during [Arabidopsis thaliana](http://www.arabidopsis.org/) reproduction as a model system.

Currently, we are identifying the molecular mechanisms that underlie specific pollen tube functions in A. thaliana such as germination, growth, guidance and growth arrest in the synergid cell of the female gametophyte.

We are located in the Marley Building at the University of Arizona.
