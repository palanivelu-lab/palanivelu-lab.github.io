#Style guide for Palanivelu Lab website.
#Written by Robbie Diaz - 2020 (Fraser Lab), updated by Cedar Warman - 2021

#Style Guide: Publications
# citation - double quotes, to avoid breaking on names with apostrophes
# all other sections - indent with 2 spaces, strings in single quotes

#Names of lab members should be bolded using the following convention: **Surname FM**.
#If there are multiple lab members in a row, include them in one set of double asterisk pairs.
#Use &#42; to add an asterisk denoting co-first/corresponding author. Otherwise, bolding of names using **Surname FM** will break.
#For readability of code, start a new line around 140 characters.
#All images and PDFs should be named using the following convention: surname_YYYY

#Leave PMID blank until an ID is assigned.

#Do not include additional subsections if they are not relevant
#to a publication.
